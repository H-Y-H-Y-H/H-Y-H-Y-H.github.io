**Knolling Bot: Learning Robotic Object Arrangement from Tidy Demonstrations**

🤖 Attention busy people! Imagine you are very busy and don't have time to tell the robot where everything should be placed!🧹 So, don't you think robots need to understand tidiness? 🤔

This paper📑 shows how robots can learn the concept of ["knolling"](https://knolling.org/) from tidy demonstrations, allowing them to automatically organize your table in a neat and efficient way. 🧹✨

It's a game-changer for household robotics! 🏠🦾 What do you think? Would you trust a robot to tidy up your space based on its understanding of tidiness? 🤔💭

**Knolling bot 2.0: Enhancing Object Organization with Self-supervised Graspability Estimation**

A robotic system that integrates visual perception, a self-supervised graspability estimation model, knolling models, and robot arm controllers to efficiently organize an arbitrary number of objects on a table, even when they are closely clustered or stacked.
