**Knolling Bot: Learning Robotic Object Arrangement from Tidy Demonstrations**

🤖 Attention busy people! Imagine you are very busy and don't have time to tell the robot where everything should be placed!🧹 So, don't you think robots need to understand tidiness? 🤔

This paper📑 shows how robots can learn the concept of ["knolling"](https://medium.com/@Lyst/your-favorite-insta-aesthetic-has-an-unexpected-history-a929e078d4ea) from tidy demonstrations, allowing them to automatically organize your table in a neat and efficient way. 🧹✨

**Egocentric Visual Self-Modeling for Autonomous Robot Dynamics Prediction and Adaptation**

Humans learn at a young age to infer what others see and cannot see from a different point-of-view, and learn to predict others’ plans and behaviors. These abilities have been mostly lacking in robots, sometimes making them appear awkward and socially inept. Here we propose an end-to-end long-term visual prediction framework for robots to begin to acquire both these critical cognitive skills, known as Visual Perspective Taking (VPT) and Theory of Behavior (TOB).

**Enhancing Object Organization with Self-supervised Graspability Estimation**

A robotic system that integrates visual perception, a self-supervised graspability estimation model, knolling models, and robot arm controllers to efficiently organize an arbitrary number of objects on a table, even when they are closely clustered or stacked.
